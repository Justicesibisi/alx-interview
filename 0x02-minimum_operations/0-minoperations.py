"""
In a text file, there is a single character H. Your text editor can execute
only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number n, write
a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in
exactly n H characters in the file.

    Prototype: def minOperations(n)
    Returns an integer
    If n is impossible to achieve, return 0

Example:

n = 9

H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste =>HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH =>
Paste => HHHHHHHHH

Number of operations: 6
