# 0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix

## Description
This project involves implementing an in-place algorithm to rotate a 2D matrix (n x n) 90 degrees clockwise. The solution focuses on minimizing space complexity by directly modifying the given matrix.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8.10
- Adheres to the pycodestyle style guide (version 2.8.0).
- No external libraries or modules are allowed.
- Fully documented code for readability and understanding.

## Usage
Run the script in Python to rotate a given matrix in-place. Ensure the input matrix is square (n x n).

## Example
Input matrix:
[ [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9] ]
